# EGU 2017: Data analysis with Python and Jupyter

During the [EGU 2017](http://egu2017.eu) we presented a short course introducing how to do data
science with Python and Jupyter. This is the material used in the course. The
course itself was 90 minutes. However, there is a bit more material that can
also be used for self-study and for finding references that go more in-depth.

## Preparation

[Install Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), Python 3.x
version. Anaconda is an open data science platform which includes Python and
most packages necessary for doing data science. Anaconda can be installed even
without root/administrator privileges.

## Material

The course is made available as a series of Jupyter Notebooks. The notebooks can
be read directly here at Github, but you will have a better, more interactive
experience by downloading them and running the locally. How to do this is
explained in [Notebook 2: Jupyter Notebooks](02_jupyter_notebooks.ipynb).

This short course is not a course in Python, the programming language. Instead
we aim to show you how Python has become a full-blown platform for doing data
science. BLAH BLAH
